# Project Title: Event Management System

## Project Overview

The Event Management System is a web-based application developed in pure PHP to allow users to create, manage, and view events, as well as register attendees and generate event reports. This system provides a seamless way to organize events and manage attendees efficiently.

## Features

#### Core Functionalities

1. User Authentication

- Secure registration and login system using password hashing.

- Role-based access control (Admin, User, Super Admin).

2. Event Management

- Create, update, view, and delete events.

- Upload event images with validation.

- Pagination, sorting, and searching for event listings.

3. Attendee Management

- Register attendees for events.

- Prevent duplicate registrations and enforce maximum event capacity.

4. Event Dashboard

- Displays events in a paginated, sortable, and filterable format.

5. Event Reports

- Download attendee lists for specific events in CSV format (Admin-only feature).

6. Search Functionality

- Search across events and attendees.

7. AJAX Integration

- Enhance user experience with AJAX-based operations (e.g., event creation, updates, and registration).

8. JSON API Endpoint

- Fetch event details programmatically via a JSON API.
